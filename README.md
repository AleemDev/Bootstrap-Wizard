Bootstrap Wizard
================

Uses Bootstrap and JQuery to provide a highly customizable and powerful wizard UI to your project.

Modified from [https://github.com/wijmo/Wijmo-Complete|Wijmo] under GPLv3 to accomodate Bootstrap styles and functionality instead of JQuery UI and Wijmo UI.

Adapted [https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/1982#issuecomment-7814657|some CSS] from [https://github.com/wotaewer|wotaewer] for the tabs.

Most of the documentation from the Wijmo Wizard apply to this wizard, so until I can get some instructions up, please refer to http://wijmo.com/wiki/index.php/Wizard

If Bootstrap Responsive is being used, Badges will automatically turn on in the tabs and text will be hidden for phone sizes. To force badges to appear on all sizes, use OL instead of UL.
